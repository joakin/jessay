======

This is a static web generator.

By default this is going to generate a blog like index and a wiki like index.

The executable is generate.py, no dependencies except python 2.7 and perl
installed.

The web is published in the folder web/

Adapt your template in the template/ folder. It uses python default template
variables, like `$variable`, and there are only 3 vars, the relative path to
the index, the title for the page and where the content will be. Simple stuff.

To generate, go to the root of your folder and do `generate.py` if you have
made the script executable and is in your path. Else, just put the jessay
folder inside your page root, and do ./jessay/generate.py
